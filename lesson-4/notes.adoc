== Lesson 4: More instructions ...

=== Not that isolated

When you want to build an image to support an application's lifecycle

If you have two containers, one running a service on *port 8080* and the other one wants to access it.
As we said, the first container doesn't expose any port by default, but we can easily solve this issue by adding the *EXPOSE* instruction to our _Dockerfile_.

==== Port Mapping

When you have an application like a web server running in a container, you may want to access it.

Traditionally, http servers listen on port 80, 443 (or 8080 and 8433).
But what would happen if 2 container were running the same http server?
If you try to run 2 nginx servers locally, the second run will fail showing a "port already binded" error.

For container, the concept of port mapping help to define which port from the host will be to communicate with the exposed port of the container.

:host_port: 12345
:container_port: 80
As said, nginx runs by default on port {container_port}, we can map it with a port from our host (like {host_port}).
So if we want to access the nginx inside of the container we can use `http://localhost:{host_port}`.

Ports are being mapped when container are started using `-p <host_port>:<container_port>`.
In the example above it would be `-p {host_port}:{container_port}`.

.Exercise
Run a container from the `nginx` image (pull it from the registry) with a port mapping and try to access the nginx server (use "/" to get the Welcome page).

.Expected output
While a curl (or equivalent):

[source]
----
$ http localhost:12345 -h
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 612

Server: nginx/1.11.10
----

NOTE: Use `-d` to run the container in background (to daemonize it).

==== Port exposition

If you want your custom image to expose a port, you have to explicitly expose it via the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/expose[EXPOSE] instruction.
The syntax is simple `EXPOSE <port>`.
Several ports can be exposed either by using the `EXPOSE` instruction several times or using `EXPOSE <port1> <port2> ....`

.Exercise
Create a docker image based on debian, install nginx, expose port 80 and that the server at runtime.
Then repeat the previous exercise.

.Expected output
After having created the image, you should be able to do:

[source]
----
$ docker run -d -p 12345:80 docker4devs:nginx

$ http localhost:12345 -h
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: text/html

Server: nginx/1.6.2
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
----

[TIP]
--
To install nginx, use those commands: `apt-get update` and `apt-get install -y nginx`.

To start the web server: `nginx -g 'daemon off;'`

=== How to add my application to the image?

Now we know how to build an image and even how to get in touch with it via Volumes and Port exposition.
The question is then, how do we incorporate our custom application like a war file into our image?

So far our images are very static.
When we start a nginx, it serves the default content available when it has been installed.
Wouldn't be interesting to copy an html file into our nginx and so we have a custom webapp running every time when run a container?

As you can imagine it's possible via a new instruction https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/copy[COPY].

The `COPY` instruction is very simple and copies the source files or directories and places them into the destination folder.

The syntax is the following `COPY <src>... <dest>`.

TIP: Sources can contain https://golang.org/pkg/path/filepath/#Match[wildcards] such as `expedia*.html`

NOTE: If sources are relative, the path will be resolved based on the directory the build command has been invoked in.

.Exercise
Based on our custom nginx image, create an image which will copy a simple html file into `/var/www/html/`.
Then start a container (don't forget the port mapping) and try to access the html file.

.Expected output
[source]
----
$ http localhost:8080/expedia.html
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: text/html

[NOTE]
--
The https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/add[ADD] instruction works the same way.
The only difference being it supports URLs and can uncompress archives.
--

=== Navigating in the filesystem

To navigate in the filesystem, we could `cd` but having a set of `RUN cd /path/ && command;` is not really maintainable, readable and easy to troubleshoot.

That's why we have the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir[WORKDIR] instruction.

This instruction set the working directory and will affect the other "path" based instructions such as RUN, CMD, COPY, ADD, etc.
The syntax is very easy `WORKDIR /path/to/workdir`.
The path can be either absolute or relative.

[NOTE]
--
WORKDIR can support environment variable.
For example:

:logspath: /opt/logs
[source, subs=attributes]
----
ENV LOGSPATH {logspath}
WORKDIR $LOGSPATH
RUN pwd
----

Will output `{logspath}`
--

.Exercise
Based on the previous image, move to `/var/www/html` before doing the copy instruction.

.Expected output
The result should be the same as the previous exercise.

TIP: Don't forget to update the COPY instruction to reflect move.
