== Lesson 6: Let's run a small app using what we've learnt so far.

=== Our small project

Today we are going to set-up a simple environment to run a web application.

Our stack will be composed of a Docker container running a *Database* (Redis) and another container running a *Web Application* (Node.js).

What we want to achieve is:

. Create a reusable _base_ image for our _Web Application_
. Pass some *arguments* to the Dockerfile at build time
. Link the *Database* container with the *Web application* container
. Mount the logs folder of each container in one folder on our host machine
. Make our _database_ persistent

=== Base images and the ONBUILD instruction

A base image is a generic purpose image that we would like to use as a base environment for multiple applications.

So far we used the _debian_ image to build all our images, and when we needed software that was not pre-installed, we used the RUN instruction and the _Debian_ package manager to get it.
This approach is perfectly fine, but it can quickly become tedious if we end doing again and again the same steps in all our _Dockerfile_.

What we can do to solve this issue is to build a normal image containing all the dependencies we need and use it as a base image for our application's Dockerfile.

In this scenario the *ONBUILD* instruction can be very useful:

The *ONBUILD* instruction adds triggers to images. A trigger is executed when the image is used as the basis of another image (e.g., if you have an image that needs source code added from a specific location that might not yet be available, or if you need to execute a build script that is specific to the environment in which the image is built).
The trigger inserts a new instruction in the build process, as if it were specified right after the FROM instruction. The trigger can be any build instruction. For example:

[source]
----
ONBUILD COPY package.json /usr/src/app/
ONBUILD RUN npm install && npm cache clean
ONBUILD COPY . /usr/src/app
----

=== The ARG instruction

The ARG instruction defines variables that can be passed at build-time via the _docker build_ command. This is done using the --build-arg flag. You can only specify build-time arguments that have been defined in the _Dockerfile_.

[source]
----
ARG BUILD
ARG PORT=8080
----

The second _ARG_ instruction sets a default, if no value is specified for the argument at build-time then the default is used. Let's use one of these arguments in a docker build now.

The same way `docker build` allow us to create an image from a dockerfile.
We can build several containers with a docker-compose file.

[source]
----
docker build --build-arg BUILD=1234 -t local/webapp .
----

As the local/webapp image is built the _BUILD_ variable will be set to 1234 and the _PORT_ variable will inherit the default value of _8080_.

.Exercise
Create a _Dockerfile_ and add the _ARG_ instruction to pass arguments at build time, then just log the value you passed in.

=== Let's compose our app

At this point we have all the pieces to build our application, so let's build it together!
