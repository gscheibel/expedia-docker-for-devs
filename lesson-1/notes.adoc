== Lesson 1: Make your own image.

:new-image-id: 769d7be53b006f7fa793e5e34483aa3c18d88564cea2c49134cd7c3e2c3274ee
:new-image-short-id: 769d7be53b00
:image-name: mySuperImage
:image-tag: v2
:second-commit-id: e1402e0cdc9a

=== How do images Docker work?

A Docker image is not a uniform block.
An image is a stack of layers piled on top of each other.
An interesting comparison would be against a git repository.
Each commit creates a SHA-1 which identifies that particular commit.
At any point in time - the history - you have a representation combining all the previous revision.

For Docker images, it works the same way.
Each layer represents a - read-only - diff of the filesystem.

.Example of an image's layer
image::image-layers.jpg[align="center"]

When we create a container out of an image, the Docker engine adds an extra read/write filesystem layer.

=== How to create a new layer?

How do you save your changes with git?
`git commit` of course. +
With Docker, it works more or less the same way.

.Exercise
From the Debian base image, create a simple `logs` folder under `/opt`.
Then exit the container.
Save your changes using the `commit` command.

[TIP]
--
You'll need the ID of your container.
You have 2 easy ways to find it:

* Lookup for the list of containers (there is a command for that)
* If you are connected to the container (TTY + Stdin session), you might have noticed the PS1 `root@[SHORT_CONTAINER_ID]`
--

.Expected result
The docker engine should output the ID of the new image.
It will look like:

[source, subs="attributes, verbatim"]
sha256: {new-image-id} <1>

<1> Where `{new-image-id}` is the new ID of the newly created image.

NOTE: You can refer to the image using either the long or the short version (12 first characters `{new-image-short-id}`).

include::solutions.adoc[tags=firstCommmit]

.Exercise
Start a new container from the image we've just created.
And check if the `/opt/logs` folder is there.

TIP: If you don't remember the images you have available on your host, try to list them of.

.Expected output
As you can image the output should be `logs`.

include::solutions.adoc[tags=rerunFirstCommmit]

NOTE: The commit command has two interesting options `-a` to specify the author and `-m` to add a message.

=== Let's make our image a bit more easy to use

As we already know, Docker images can have names and tags.
When you commit an image you can specify the `repository`, it means simply its name like `debian` is the name for the image `e5599115b6a6`.

.Exercise
From the image created during the previous exercise, add a file in the logs folder.
Then commit this new change but with a name for your image.

.Expected result
The output should look the same as for the previous exercise but with a new ID.

include::solutions.adoc[tags=commitWithName]

==== Tagging

Tags are used to set the version of the image.
Like you would have with the version of a piece of software or a library.

Tags can pretty much be any string.
Remember `debian:latest` and `debian:jessie-slim`

.Exercise
Add a new file into the logs folder of `{image-name}` but this time when you commit add a tag to this version.
Then list your local images and see the different tags you have for your image.

.Expected output
The list command output should look like

[source, subs="attributes"]
----
REPOSITORY      TAG         IMAGE ID
{image-name}    {image-tag}          e1402e0cdc9a
{image-name}    latest      {second-commit-id}
----

include::solutions.adoc[tags=commitWithTag]

==== Sharing your image

If we can pull images, we should be able to push right?
When we want to add or share a library, we are used to using a central repository like Maven Central, Ruby Gems, NPM repositories and so on.

With Docker it works the same way.
The default repository is named https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub].

On Docker Hub, you'll be able to find plenty of images.
Some of them are called officials and are maintained by the same team developing the solution.
Have a look at the https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/[Debian page] for instance.

Next to the officials, anybody can have a repository and push custom images like https://hub.docker.com/r/gscheibel/expedia-docker-for-devs/[the one] created for this lesson.

===== Prepare the image

:hub-repository-name: expedia-docker-for-devs
:hub-account-name: gscheibel

To push an image into the Hub, first you need an account.
Then you have to create a new repository let say `{repository-name}`.

After that on your machine, you tag the image you want to push with the name of you repository.

To do so, use the `tag` command.
It follows the following format:

[source, subs="quotes"]
docker tag IMAGE_ID HUB_ACCOUNT_NAME**/**HUB_REPOSITORY_NAME**:**VERSION

If I want to share the image `{second-commit-id}` as my {expedia-docker-for-devs} image, the command will then be:

[source, subs="attributes,verbatim"]
docker tag {second-commit-id} {hub-account-name}/{hub-repository-name} <1>

<1> If you don't specify the tag version it will be `latest` by default.

===== Pushing the image

Now we have a our image, let's push it to the hub.

First step we have to log in to the Hub from our terminal using `docker login`.

image::docker-login.png[align=center]

Second step, push it using `docker push {hub-account-name}/{hub-repository-name}`

image::docker-push.png[align=center]

Finally, if we look at our repository in the hub - under the Tags tab - we have our image.
