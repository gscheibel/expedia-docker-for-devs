== Lesson 3: Containers and the rest of the world

=== Not that isolated

One of the main features of Docker is the _isolation_ of containers.
A running _container_, by default, can't communicate with other containers or with the host machine.
Furthermore, once you created an _image_, you can only read and write files within the running _container_.

We can now communicate over network with our _container_, but what if we would like to share some data?
We just need to add the *VOLUME* instruction to our _Dockerfile_.
A _volume_ is a special kind of directory that provides several useful features:

- Volumes can be shared and reused between containers.
- A container doesn't have to be running to share its volumes.
- Changes to a volume are made directly.
- Changes to a volume will not be included when you update an image.
- Volumes persist until no containers use them.

=== Volumes Sharing

As we know, when we write on the filesystem, we actually write on a temporary layer which is not persistent across all the containers.
To be able to share files with the outside world, we can mount an external Volume and attach it to around(?) container.

A volume can be a simple file or a directory which is mounted when the container is run.

==== Between the Host and the container

To be able to share files between the host and the container, you have to mount a local folder and map it with a folder from the container.
The mount operation is as simple as adding a new argument to the run command.

That argument is `-v <host_path>:<container_path>`.

NOTE: Both path must the absolute.

:host_directory: $\{PWD}/docker4devs
:container_directory: /opt/logs

.Exercise
Run a container (with an interactive terminal) and shared a directory between your host and the container.
For example we can use `{host_directory}` from our host and `{container_directory}` on the container side.

Once the container is started, go inside of `{container_directory}`.
Then open a second terminal (on the host), and go to `{host_directory}`.

At this point, perform a series of `ls` and `touch` commands on both sides.
Finally, exit the container and perform a last `ls` on the host directory.

.Expected result
Files created from the container are persisted in the host directory even after the container has been exited.

[NOTE]
--
In both cases, if <host_path> or <container_path> don't exist, Docker will create them.

If some files were already existing in the container, the overlay added by the mount will "hide" the files.
One the volumes are unmounted, the original files will be accessible again.

==== Between containers

As we've seen, the `-v` argument mounts a local (host) folder.
But how can we share file between containers?

===== Exposing volumes
First, the container has to expose the volumes to share.
This operation is possible via the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#/volume[VOLUME] instruction in the Dockerfile.

Let's take the following Dockerfile:

include::dockerfiles/sharedVolume[lines=1..4]

To expose `/opt/logs`, we can use the `VOLUME` instruction.
The syntax is either `VOLUME ["folder1", "folder2"]` or `VOLUME folder1 folder2`.

Which gives in our case:

include::dockerfiles/sharedVolume[]

===== Sharing

:first_container_name: containerWithVolume
:second_container_name: secondContainer

Let's assume, we have a first container running which exposes a volume and that container is named (using the `--name` argument) `{first_container_name}`.
To run a second container (`{second_container_name}`) which can access the volume exposed by `{first_container_name}`, there is the `--volumes-from [CONTAINER]` argument.

With this argument, when a file is written in one of the exposed volumes on the first container.
This file (in the same location), will be accessible in the second container and vice versa.

NOTE: the sharing is bidirectional.

.Exercise
Create and build an image declaring a volume.
Run a container from it (with a name).

Then run another container, which will access the volume.
Finally share some files between the two.


.Expected output

From the container sharing the volume:
[source, subs="attributes"]
----
$ root@{first_container_name}:/opt/logs# ls
fromContainerOne  fromContainerTwo
----

From the container accessing the volume:

[source, subs="attributes"]
----
$ root@{second_container_name}:/opt/logs# ls
fromContainerOne  fromContainerTwo
----

include::solutions.adoc[tags=exposedVolume]

NOTE: We can even have one of those container sharing a volume with the host and then the sharing can be done among the three parts.
