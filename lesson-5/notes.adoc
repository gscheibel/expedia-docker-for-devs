== Lesson 5: Docker-compose or how to be even more declarative and automated.

=== How does it work?

In the previous lessons, we have seen how to build images based on a declarative file `Dockerfile`.
When comes the time to run container, we know we can use `docker run`.
Which means if we need to start several containers, we have to run several valid run commands and ensure there are no conflicts between any of the containers (i.e. mapping to the same port).

Docker-compose is a tool created to simplify how to define and run multi-container applications.
A multi-container application could provide a service and its database or host several copies of the same application behind a reverse proxy.

The same the Dockerfile is used to declare how to build the image, the `docker-compose.yml` is going to be used to declare how to run it

Docker-compose is based on a yml file named by default `docker-compose.yml`.
The file defines services, network and volumes configurations.

The file is structured as:

[source]
----
version: '3.0' <1>

services: <2>
  my-first-service: <3>
    <place holder for directives>
----

<1> The version refers to the compose file reference version, here 3.0 being the latest one
<2> `services:` indicates the section reserved for the configurations which will be applied to containers
<3> The name of the service, you can have several of them (each name must be unique).

NOTE: As the file is yaml (or yml) based, the indentation is important.


=== Up and running

:imageName: docker4devs:nginx
During the previous lesson, we created our own custom nginx image `{imageName}`.
To run a container from this image, the command would look like `docker run -p 8080:80 {imageName}`.

With docker-compose, we can declare how to run our nginx service.
As part of the service description we have then to specify the `image: {imageName}`.
For the port mappings, as we can have several values reflecting `8080:80` and `8443:443` for instance, we have to use a yaml list:

[source]
----
ports:
  - <host_port_1>:<container_port_1>
  - <host_port_2>:<container_port_2>
----

NOTE: You can apply the same principle with `volumes` instead of `ports` in order to mount volumes at runtime.

To run our service, all we need is the `docker-compose up` command.

.Exercise
Create a docker-compose file which describes how to run the nginx service and then run it.

.Expected output
Docker-compose should display:

[source]
----
Recreating dockerfiles_nginx_1
Attaching to dockerfiles_nginx_1
----

Of course, you can then access your application as usual.

==== Build, up and running

The same way `docker build` allows us to create a single image from a dockerfile.
We can build several containers with a docker-compose file.

"How?", you ask.
Just add the `build` property as part of your service declaration.

The `build` property has 2 flavors:

* It can follow by the path of the build context. Either a path to a directory containing a Dockerfile, or a url to a git repository eg: `build: ./path/context`
* It can be an object with 3 possible sub properties:
** `context` being the same as the one mentioned above.
** `dockerfile` being the name of the file to build
** `args` being the list of arguments to pass to the build process (same as `--build-arg` for `docker build`)

NOTE: If the image doesn't exist, Compose will try to pull it from the registry unless there is a build property.

.Exercise
Let's add a build section to our docker-compose file.

.Expected output
If you already have the image in your local repository nothing should have changed.
Otherwise you should notice the engine outputs the build steps.

In the console you should notice something that looks like:

TIP: If you want to rebuild each time, add the `--build` to the `docker-compose up` command.

TIP: If you only want to build, use `docker-compose build`.

=== More volumes sharing

We've seen previously we can share volumes between containers with the `--volumes-from` argument.
The same thing can be done with Compose.

Let's look at the following example:

[source]
----
version: '3.0'

services:
  webapp:
    image: docker4devs:webapp
    volumes:
      - shared-volume:/container/path <3>

  splunk-forwarder:
    image: expedia-splunk-forwarder
    volumes:
      - shared-volume:/forwarder/path <3>

volumes: <1>
  shared-volume: <2>
----

<1> The `volumes` section describes the shared volumes
<2> The simplest case is to mount a local volume (look at `docker volume ls` and `docker volume inspect` for more details)
<3> The first part of the mapping is the name for the shared volume followed by exposed path.

NOTE: There are several syntaxes that can be used for the volume mapping see: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volumes-volumedriver[]
